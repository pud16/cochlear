# cochlear
This project contains a Python script that simulates the sound perception of a child with a cochlear implant. Cochlear implants are electrical devices that help people with trauma or profound hearing loss perceive sounds. They stimulate the auditory nerves by producing electrical signals that mimic the functions of the inner ear.
